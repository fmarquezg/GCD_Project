#CodeBook

This Codebook describes the variables explored and defined in the data set for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

## The data source

* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Data Set Summary Information
Data collected from a group of 30 volunteers (19-48 year olds).  Each performed six (6) activitites, (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING,LAYING) wearing a smartphone on the waist.
The data collected has been split to group 70% of the individuals into the training data and the remainder 30% into the test data.


## The Extracted data Zip File contains

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': Lists all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.


## Transformation Details

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
